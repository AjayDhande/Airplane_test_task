Airplane seating algorithm


A ruby program that helps seat audiences in a flight based on the
following input and rules.

Rules for seating:
• Always seat passengers starting from the front row to back,
starting from the left to the right
• Fill aisle seats first followed by window seats followed by center
seats (any order in center seats)
Input to the program will be
• a 2D array that represents the rows and columns [ [3,2], [4,3], [2,3], [3,4] ]
• Number of passengers waiting in queue.
If there were 30 passengers from then the seating output will be ...
Let say input A 2D array that represents the rows and columns:
[ [3,2], [4,3], [2,3], [3,4] ]
If there were 30 passengers from then check the seating output in the 0-Dev-Airplane-.pdf file.

Output expected in solving this problem:

1. The Logic / Data structure / Algorithm used to successfully complete the programming challenge
2. The elegance of the code, modularity and readability
3. A VISUAL output that is printed (on the screen, in a console or exported to a file etc.) in way that is easy to read, identify the aisle, middle and window rows and has clear seating plan and passenger number.
4. Testability, TDD and test cases
